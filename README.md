# dsa-python
so, my memory sucks. specifically, i kind of suck at remembering the specific
inner workings of data structures (like what's going on with avl trees?) and
algorithms (the fuck is A*??).

i've decided to remedy that with this repo, which will be a collection of
various basic ds/a that I've learned so far and implemented in python.
