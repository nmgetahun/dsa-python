# dsa-python
So, my memory sucks. Specifically, I kind of suck at remembering the specific
inner workings of data structures (like how AVL trees maintain balance) and
algorithms (what the fuck is A* even??). I've decided to remedy that with
this repo, which will be a collection of various basic ds/a that I've learned so
far implemented in Python.
