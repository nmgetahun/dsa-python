Merge Sort
----------
Given two sorted arrays of lengths n and m, we can merge the two arrays into one
sorted array of length n + m by repeatedly adding the smallest element at the
front of both arrays to our new list; this takes O(n + m) time. Using this
method, we can also divide up an unsorted list into halves, sort those, and then
merge the two halves in O(n) (O(n / 2 + n / 2)) time. Merge sort works by
combining these two principles and recursively halving then merging our list
to sort it in O(nlogn) time.

Cases:
    List has less than 2 elements: cannot halve -> return itself
    List has 2+ elements: - divide list into two halves
                          - merge sort those halves
                          - we now have two sorted lists
                          - merge into one sorted list

Complexity:
    Time: O(nlogn)
    Space: O(n)
